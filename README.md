For this project, we analyzed two different datasets and created breakdowns for each. We analyzed the financial records of a bank to write important information such as the total profits, the month with the greatest increase in profits, the month with the greatest decrease in profits, and more. We also went over a dataset of election results to find the total number of votes casted, the percent of votes per candidate, and the winner of the election. In both these assignments, we had to import csv files into our python script in order to add the values we were working with into lists. Once these values were in lists, we were able to reference these lists in order to calculate for averages, minimums, maximums, percentages, and more. After we completed our analyses, we printed our analyses in both the command prompt and in a text file located within an “analysis” folder.
